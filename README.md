# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮✂️📄

Welcome to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** project! This is a simple console-based game written in **C#** using the latest .NET framework. 🎉
## 🎯 About the Project
This project brings the timeless game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to life in a digital format. The player competes against a computer opponent to see who can emerge victorious. The game tracks points, determines winners for each round, and even includes a quirky "lava rocks!" move from the computer for some unexpected fun. 🔥

## 🖥️ Programming Language

- **.NET (Latest Version)**: Leveraging the most modern and efficient features available in the framework.
